# Only closed ones are in unconditional relationships other than that everyone is in a conditional relationship.

I Think we are always unable to understand or mainly misunderstand the relationship between each other. To clarify what I want to say, let's have an example: Imagine I’m your best friend and we've been with each other for 5 years now. And now also imagine you had a new friend from last year. Today an accident happened with me and your other friend too, and we both called you for help. We both were at different places and argued with you yesterday. Now what you’ll do ? Which friend do you prefer first for giving help ?

Undoubtedly you’ll prefer a friend who has been with you for 5 years. At the time of making a decision you’ll never think for a second to give any help to your best friend and here’s comes the unconditional relation between you and your best friend. And you can send another friend to help that another friend, which is conditional because they argued with you yesterday.
