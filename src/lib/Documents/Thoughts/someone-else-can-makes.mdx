I think Happiness and unhappiness both are choices in almost every situation. It totally depends on perspective. <QuoteBlock>"If your happiness depends on anybody or anything else, then you're never gonna be happy anymore."</QuoteBlock> Every situation has results that can be accepted as either happiness or unhappiness. However, there are some situations which have a default state of Happiness or Unhappiness, but if we follow this choice-based perspective it is still a choice.

Also, some of us always struggle to be happy; there is no reason for unhappiness or sadness; they are not happy. I think that happens because we always treat our mind to be in a problematic situation and as a result the mind always considers every situation as a problem and tries to find happiness. So in actual situations of happiness the mind finds the problem or reasons to become sad. And hence you're not happy anymore.

But the actual question is, what is happiness and unhappiness ? And if you think deeply, happiness is the end goal of our lives,Whatever we do in our life is just for our personal happiness. Let's take a few examples. We all work and earn from our way of sources, and we use that money to buy services which help to live a better life and that better life makes us satisfied which is the actual happiness. So we end up with happiness. Let's take another one. We all do things which allow us to become satisfied and that allow us to become happy.

So happiness is directly connected to the feeling of satisfaction. You'll never find anyone who is unsatisfied but still happy. The feeling of happiness generates from the feeling of satisfaction. And whatever we do in our life to be satisfied with a given or available situation or things is under of choice.

A Millionaire is unsatisfied because they is not a billionaire, and a Billionaire is unsatisfied because they is not a trillionaire. And that's the infinity or loop in everything. Everyone is unsatisfied with given things or situations. As humans we always want more and more.

And at the end you'll notice that to be satisfied you have to choose to become satisfied, which leads you to become happy.
