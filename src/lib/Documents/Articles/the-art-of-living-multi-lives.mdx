<Quote>"The Art of Living Multiple Lives in one"</Quote>, the art itself
highlights what they want to say and how important it is. There are too many
successful people in the world right now who suggest that <Quote>
  “Reading is a thing which helps them to achieve success

also helps us to understand the importance of reading but not completely.

Reading is an essential part of our life which always returns us some better results. Reading enhances imagination power, reading makes you more knowledgeable and also improves vocabulary and language proficiency. Reading makes us a better decision-maker as we understand things more deeply and can consider them from a different perspective. It also enhances the communication skills and makes socially a good person. With reading, we can acquire knowledge in different areas like culture, arts, history, regions and much more.

Reading books and other stuff always increases creativity and enhances the understanding about life. Reading also inspires to write and one can fall in love with writing as well. The most important reason for reading is that we experience the situation of the author without living that situation in real life at all in case of non-fiction self-help books. But in other areas of books like fiction we receive tons of new information and also it helps to improve the power of imaginations.

This is too much about the book but the main title of the article is that art which helps to live a multiple life at once. Which is also a reading but not fiction, it’s non-fiction books about life. What fiction books do for us, you know that already but what Non-Fiction books do is more than that.

In every book the author includes their perspective towards that particular topic and shares their thinking process, experience, information, vision, view about that topic and many more things regarding that particular topic. And as we know our life has limited time to live and due to limited time we can’t test every situation in our life to collect our own information and perspective towards that particular topic and situations. Hence, we need to read books and articles about not only that problematic particular topic but every topic that is in your interest or you’ll read it. Because it always consists of a new perspective and experience of the author which we'll get if we read books.

Now You have the perspective, experience and information about that particular situation or topics or problem which you haven't experienced yet and you have more information than an average person which you can use as per your needs in your life to make better decisions and no need to test that situation again and again to waste our limited time. I know that everyone has different situations in their life, different problems but this information will always help you to make better decisions.
